/**
 * This file handles creating comms within both JupyterLab and Notebooks. There is a fair
 * bit of complexity here, a we must handle a variety of failure modes. 
 * 
 * When you save a notebook in lab that has a rendered notebook in it, 
 * the notebook will be saved with the JS output. Thus, when you reopen the notebook (from lab or notebook) 
 * this js code will reexecute. So: Mito will be rendered, a new frontend object representing the comm will be 
 * recreated, and (since it's the first time Mito is being rendered) the analysis will be replayed 
 * from the start (since the backend has already replayed the analysis, this is just a noop).
 * 
 * Now, as is, this isn't a huge problem if you literally just refresh the page. The problem comes 
 * when you restart the kernel, and then refresh the page. Mito renders (again thinking it's the first
 * time it's been rendered), and tries to create a comm. But since no comm has been registered on the 
 * backend already, no messages can be received by the backend, or send from the backend. So the 
 * frontend thinks a comm is created (as Jupyter will happily create a frontend comm even if it doesn't
 * hook up anywhere). 
 * 
 * Thus, we need a way of detecting three distinct cases:
 * 1.   No comm can be created by the frontend (the install is broken, the extension that creates the comm isn't working)
 * 2.   A comm can be created, but it has no connection to the backend, becuase the JS has run but the mitosheet.sheet call
 *      has not been run (the case described in the paragraph above)
 * 3.   The comm has been created and connects successfully to the backend. 
 * 
 * This third case is the one case where we actually have a working mitosheet. In this case, we can 
 * proceded with things going well.
 * 
 * There is additional complexity, due to _when_ the JS that renders the mitosheet actually runs. Specifically,
 * the JS that renders the mitosheet runs _before_ the window.commands have been set / the extension has been
 * setup. So we need take special care to wait around, when we're trying to make the comms, and try and make it
 * for a few seconds.
 * 
 * We solve this just by a) waiting for a bit before giving up on trying to create the frontend comm, and b)
 * manually checking that the comm is hooked up to the backend. If either of these conditions are not true, 
 * we return an error to the user.

/**
 * Note the difference between the Lab and Notebook comm interfaces. 
 * 
 * To work, Lab needs to have .open() called on it before sending any messages,
 * and you set the onMsg handler directly. 
 * 
 * Notebook does not need any .open() to be called, and also requires 
 * the message handler to be passed to as on_msg((msg) => handle it).
 * 
 * We need to take special care to ensure we treat any new comms interface how it 
 * expects to be treated, as they are all likely slighly different.
